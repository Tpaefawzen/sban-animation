== What they do ==
Tools to generate

- morse code animation
- lattice animation
- braille animation

from MIDI file. Very simplified so you may want to customize scripts.

== Prerequired items ==
Languages are Python and shellscript.
The shell scripts try to invoke magick(1) from ImageMagick and ffmpeg(1) from FFmpeg.

== File name naming convention ==
LevelN where N increments from 0

== Procedures: preparation ==
1. Generate your MIDI file with your DAW software.
2. ./mid2level0.py
3. ./level0-to-level1.sh
4. And how do I describe each item for morse code animation generator, lattice animation generator, and braille animation generator?

== Morse code animation generator ==
1. Make two images: one for when morse is off and the other is for off.
2. ./tolevel2.sh, ...

== Lattice animation generator ==
1. ./generate.sh in img
2. ./tolevel2.sh, ...

== Braille animation generator ==
1. ./generate.sh in img
2. ./tolevel2.sh, ...
